Fields to merge.

The values of these fields will be merged into the _first_ partial event. \
Fields not specified here will be ignored. Merging process takes the first \
buffered partial event, then loops over the rest of them and merges in the \
fields from each buffered partial event. The last event with the field takes \
priority and overrides the previous event.

Finally, the non-partial event fields are merged in, producing the resulting \
merged event.\
